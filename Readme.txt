The code below is a single file of Python code that can be used to determine the maximum saving that can be achieved from a given input network. 
Inside this file, the code calls a function that has the following boilerplate format as shown below:


def maximum_saving(input_network: str) -> int:
  # parse the input network input here, possibly calling other functions that
  # you've written in your Python code file

  # possibly call other functions that you've written in your Python code
  # file to determine the maximum saving that can be achieved by removing
  # redundant edges whilst ensuring that the network remains connected.


  # return the (integer) maximum saving
  return max_saving
